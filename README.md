## React CRUD App With Hooks and Context API
In this app, we'll make a simple CRUD app that can add, update, or delete users.

## Info
> Since I'm not using a real *API* and *Database*, which would probably have an auto-incrementing ID, I'm going to increment the ID of the new user manually. 
> Initially I have been used useState() and useEffect() Hooks. Bootstrap V4 is used for UY design
